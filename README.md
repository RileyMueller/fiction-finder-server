# fiction-finder-server
Backend for my FictionFinder website

This has been abandoned because I have discovered Pinecone.io
I may comeback to this if I need to have serverside functions for creating new embeddings and sending to Pinecone.
For now though, simply serving a static website that makes requests to Pinecone is sufficient.
